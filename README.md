# JavaScript Tetris

This is a simple JavaScript implementation of popular brick game Tetris. The structure
of the app is flexible, contains several lossly coupled and reuseable components:


- Matrix tools (2D matrix representation, factory, transformer, moves, collisions detector, jQuery based stage renderer, position manager<!--Please, refactor me!!-->, lines detector, score counter, bricks provider)
- Event Dispatcher (Simple but useable) - the central point of the application


The app contains pretty ugly CSS, but it does the job.
